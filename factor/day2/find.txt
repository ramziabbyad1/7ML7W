1) a third way of setting factor roots

You can add vocabulary roots by calling a word from .factor-rc file. This file is run every time factor starts up (i.e. is invoked from the command line)

within this file you can put

"/home/ramzi/7langs7weeks/factor/day2/factor" add-vocab-root

2) factor scripts can be deployed as a single OS executable.  See (http://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-tools.deploy.html)

using tools.deploy it is possible to programatically build a factor source-tree with a MAIN: hook.

Before deploying, a configuration file must be included to describe dependencies.
